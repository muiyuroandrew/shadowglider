Shadow Glider

This would be a game where the player controls a geometric shape (e.g., a sphere) that moves through a 3D environment. 
The objective is to navigate through obstacles, with the challenge increasing as the player progresses. 
The game will implement ray tracing to handle shadows, reflections, and refractions.
